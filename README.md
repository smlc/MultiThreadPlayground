# Virtual thread playground.

This is a repo I use to play with Java virtual thread to understand their limitation and advantage.
I will implement some classical multithreading problems using virtual thread and normal thread.


## Blocking queue

To implement a blocking queue we mainly need to block the different thread to not access the queue at the same time. 
So this is mainly a synchronization problem.

The different way to do synchronization of threads in Java are :

- `synchronized`
- `ReentrantLock`
- `ReadWriteLock`
- `Atomic Classes`
- `Semaphore`

### Synchronized and virtual thread

Synchronization made using the `synchronized` keyword can block (pinned) a virtual thread. 
That why if we are using virtual thread we should avoid anything implement using this kind of Synchronization.

Why `synchronized` pinned virtual thread and not ReentrantLock ?
When virtual thread enter a synchronized block the carrier thread will get blocked, it's not the case for ReentrantLock,
because they are not implemented with synchronized.

What does it mean the lock are reentrant ?

Reentrancy means a thread can acquire the same lock it already holds. This is useful when a synchronized method calls another synchronized method of the same object. 
Without reentrancy, such calls would deadlock.
